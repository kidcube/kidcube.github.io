<p>This document is part of the KidCube terms and conditions. It applies to users who have purchased the premium version of KidCube. <a href="/privacy/">See Terms and Conditions</a> for more details.</p>
<p>KidCube’s premium features are purchased online or via Apple’s iTunes store. When you purchase these features, you are also subject to the iTunes terms of service.</p>
<h3 id="payment-plan">Payment plan</h3>
<p>The basic version of KidCube is available for free. To access the premium features of KidCube, which has additional features, including (but not limited to) goals &amp; personalised training, access to all games, access to advanced statistics, comparisons with other users and early access to new games, you will have to pay via an auto-renewing subscription from Apple’s iTunes store.</p>
<h3 id="renewals-and-cancellations">Renewals and cancellations</h3>
<p>KidCube is purchased via an iTunes auto-renewing subscription. This means your subscription is automatically renewed at the end of the subscription period.</p>
<p>You can modify or cancel your subscription at any time from within the application (if purchased online) or by signing in to your iTunes account on your computer or iOS or Android device and changing the settings.</p>

<p>If purchased online please contact our Customer Service team at <a href="mailto:info@KidCube.com">info@KidCube.com</a>. Otherwise your payment is managed by Apple via iTunes and you will need to contact Apple customer service for refunds, as we are not able to process refunds ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-changes">Pricing changes</h3>
<p>We may change the pricing plan at our discretion. In this case we will try to inform you before any changes so you can modify or cancel your subscription before the changes are made.

You may not assign lifetime subscription plans to any other person. We make no warranties or representations as to the expected lifetime of the KidCube services, and in purchasing a lifetime plan, you acknowledge and agree that the KidCube services could change or terminate in the future.</p>
